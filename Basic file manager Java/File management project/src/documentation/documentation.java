/**
* This documentation explains the design of the File Management Application.
* 
* Design Patterns Used:
* 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC): The application is organized into Model (FileManager),
*    View (StartUpUI, ChoicesUI, CreateFileUI, DeleteFileUI, EditFileUI), and Controller
*    (MainController) components.
* 
* Reasoning:
* - MVC separates concerns, making the codebase modular and easier to maintain.
* - FileManager handles file operations, UI classes represent different screens, and
*   MainController coordinates between them.
* - Each UI class is responsible for displaying its respective screen elements.
* 
* Additional Considerations:
* - Error handling, validation, and further features can be added as needed.
